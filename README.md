# Unity 2D Platformer â€“ Learning Project ðŸŽ®

This is my first Unity project as I transition from Cocos2d to Unity.  
I'm building a basic 2D platformer with movement, jumping, coins, and obstacles.

### ðŸš§ Current Goals:
- [ ] Set up Unity project
- [ ] Add player movement & jump
- [ ] Add collectibles (coins)
- [ ] Basic level design
- [ ] Build WebGL demo or APK

### ðŸ’¡ Why this project?
To practice Unity and demonstrate my ability to learn new engines and ship small games.

Stay tuned! I'll be pushing updates as I progress.
